SpaceX Falcon 9 
The SpaceX Falcon 9 is a reusable, two-stage rocket that can safely carry passengers and payloads into Earth orbit and beyond. The first reusable rocket of the orbital class is called Falcon 9. Reusability enables SpaceX to relaunch the rocket's most expensive components, lowering the cost of space access.
Nine Merlin engines and aluminum-lithium alloy tanks with liquid oxygen and rocket-grade kerosene (RP-1) propellant are included in the first stage of Falcon 9. The Falcon 9 produces more than 1.7 million pounds of force at sea level.
The payload of the Falcon 9 is delivered to the desired orbit by the second stage, which is propelled by a single Merlin vacuum engine. A few seconds after stage separation, the second stage engine fires, and it can be restarted several times to deliver various payloads to various orbits.
The pneumatic pushers that enable the first and second stages to separate during a flight are housed in the interstage, a composite structure that joins the first and second stages.
At the base of the interstage, four hypersonic grid fins are a feature of Falcon 9. By shifting the center of pressure, they may rotate the rocket during re-entry.
FAIRING The fairing, which is made of a carbon composite material, shields satellites as they go toward orbit. About three minutes into the flight, the fairing is discarded, and SpaceX continues to recover fairings for future missions.
Up to 7 people and/or cargo can be transported by Dragon in the pressurized portion of the spacecraft. Dragon may also transport freight in its unpressurized trunk, which can also hold a secondary payload.

When a rocket is launched, its first stage returns to Earth, but its second stage goes to the space station. SpaceX has claimed that it can deliver the Falcon 9 rocket to the International Space Station at a lower price than other competitors. The lower price is because this company can reuse the first stage. 
Let's predict whether the first stage will land successfully, and SpaceX will be able to use this stage again or not.  I use the necessary data from the SpaceX company's API, which has made the data publicly available to everyone.
